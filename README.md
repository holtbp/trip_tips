# Trip Tips

## Terminology
* Getaway - this is a "trip," encapsulating everything from the moment you leave home to the moment you return home.
* Stop - represents a place you will stay overnight. For this project, I have connected all Adventures to Stops, so you can keep a list of places you want to see/things you want to do on each Stop
* Adventure - a sight you want to see. Allows for notes about what you want to do/see on each Adventure. Adventures can be located in different cities from their stop though. For example, you could stay in Amsterdam and travel to The Hague for the afternoon just to see the Mauritshuis.
